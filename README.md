Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio web site! 

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, which showcases my diverse skillset, passion for problem-solving, and deep understanding of data-driven decision-making. Feel free to explore the projects and get a glimpse of my expertise in programming, data analysis, and visualization.

</a>: I use Git for version control, allowing me to track changes in my code, collaborate with others, and easily revert to previous versions if necessary. GitHub serves as the remote repository for my code and the platform where I host my portfolio website using GitHub Pages.
