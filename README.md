**HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and visually appealing front end for my portfolio website. This ensures a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes.

**Flask**: I chose Flask, to develop the back end of my website. This allows me to serve my projects and easily integrate any data analysis or machine learning components in the future and collect data from inquiries.

**Django**: Django version of this website is under development
